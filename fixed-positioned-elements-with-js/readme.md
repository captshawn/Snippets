Fixed Positioned Element with Javascript
================================================
This snippet will show you how to set any element on your page to have 'fixed' positioning once that element reaches the top of the page on window scroll.

Step 1
------
Add the below JS to your boilerplate CompanyMain.js file.  Make sure it is inside of the document ready function. Update the $fixedElement variable to the selector on your page that needs to be 'fixed'. 

Step 2
------
Add the below CSS to the stylesheet where your styles exist for your element that is becoming 'fixed'.  Update ".fixed-element" to the selector on your page that needs to be 'fixed'. You will most likely need to add 'top' and 'left' or 'right' properties to align the element on the page properly.
