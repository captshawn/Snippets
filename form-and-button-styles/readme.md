Form and Button Styles
===============================================
By default, the boilerplate strips all styles from all form elements, with the expectation that developers will create custom form styles that match the site.  If there are no existing forms on the old site to base form styles off of, then you can use styles from this snippet to apply basic styles to global forms and buttons across your portal.  

Step 1
--------
In CompanyStyle.css locate the "FORMS" section.  Find the "All Global Forms" sub-section.  Replace the entire sub-section with the styles from "Form CSS".

Step 2
--------
In CompanyStyle.css locate the "BUTTONS" section.  Find the "All Global Buttons (Excluding CTAs)" sub-section.  Replace the entire sub-section with the code from "Button CSS".
