Create A Row Containing an Odd Number of Modules
================================================
By default, the Bootstrap Grid used by the COS does not accomodate an odd number of columns. This becomes a problem when a customer's footer, for instance, requires 5 equal columns of content. Follow the steps below for an easy workaround to this issue.
Step 1
------
In the template builder, create a row with 5, 7, 9, or 11 modules.  Your modules should be unequal widths in the template builder.
Step 2
------
Wrap them all in a module group.

Step 3
------
Select the appropriate class below and apply it as the 'Custom CSS Class' of the module group.

-.seven-col-wrapper
-.nine-col-wrapper
-.eleven-col-wrapper
