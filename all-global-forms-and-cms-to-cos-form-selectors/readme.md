All Global Forms and Migrated CMS to COS Form Selectors
=======================================================
Portals that have been migrated over from the CMS using the COS to CMS Migration tool have forms with a different html output than COS portals that have been built from scratch.

These snippets will lay out all available form & button selectors for these migrated forms, COMBINED with the selectors for all global form & button selectors.

1) For all-global-forms-and-cms-to-cos-form-selectors.css
In CompanyStyle.css, scroll down to the "FORMS" section and find the "All Global Forms" sub section.  Replace the entire contents of this section with the code from the snippet.


2) For all-global-buttons-and-cms-to-cos-buttons.css
In CompanyStyle.css, scroll down to the "BUTTONS" section and find the "All Global Buttons (Excluding CTAs)" sub section.  Replace the entire contents of this section with the code from the snippet.
