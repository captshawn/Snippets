  * Hide Menu on CMS to COS Migrated Landing Pages
  *
  * Since migrated Site Pages and Landing Pages share the same templates,
  * this is the only way to safely hide custom primary menu for migrated landing 
  * pages only.
  *
  * A body class of .cms-migrated must be added to all Foxboro templates to 
  * ensure that only those migrated pages, and not brand new landing pages, 
  * have a hidden custom primary menu.
