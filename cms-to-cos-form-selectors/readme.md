Migrated CMS to COS Form Selectors
==================================
Portals that have been migrated over from the CMS using the CMS to COS Migration tool have forms with a different html output than COS portals that have been built from scratch.

These snippets will lay out all available form & button selectors for these migrated forms.

1) For cms-to-cos-form-selectors.css
------------------------------------
In CompanyStyle.css, scroll down to the "BUTTONS" section and find the "Google Search Form" sub section.  Add the contents of this snippet AFTER that sub section.


2) For cms-to-cos-buttons.css
-----------------------------
In CompanyStyle.css, scroll down to the "BUTTONS" section and find the "CTA Buttons" sub section.  Add the contents of this snippet AFTER that sub section.
