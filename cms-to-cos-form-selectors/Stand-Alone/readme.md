Migrated CMS to COS Form Selectors
==================================
Portals that have been migrated over from the CMS using the CMS to COS Migration tool have forms with a different html output than COS portals that have been built from scratch.

These snippets will lay out all available form & button selectors for these migrated forms.

Step 1
------------------------------------
In CompanyStyle.css, scroll down to the "BUTTONS" section and find the "Google Search Form" sub section.  Add the contents of Forms CSS AFTER that sub section.


Step 2
-----------------------------
In CompanyStyle.css, scroll down to the "BUTTONS" section and find the "CTA Buttons" sub section.  Add the contents of Buttons CSS AFTER that sub section.
