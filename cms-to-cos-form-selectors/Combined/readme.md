Migrated CMS to COS Form Selectors COMBINED with Global Form Selectors
=======================================================================
Portals that have been migrated over from the CMS using the COS to CMS Migration tool have forms with a different html output than COS portals that have been built from scratch.

These snippets will lay out all available form & button selectors for these migrated forms, COMBINED with the selectors for all global form & button selectors.

Step 1
------
In CompanyStyle.css, scroll down to the "FORMS" section and find the "All Global Forms" sub section.  Replace the entire contents of this section with the code from Forms CSS.

Step 2
------
In CompanyStyle.css, scroll down to the "BUTTONS" section and find the "All Global Buttons (Excluding CTAs)" sub section.  Replace the entire contents of this section with the code from Buttons CSS.
